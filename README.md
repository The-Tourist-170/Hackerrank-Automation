Explore JavaScript automation for HackerRank with two methods: promise chaining &amp; async/await. Simplify your tasks efficiently!
Automated HackerRank Using JavaScript

This GitHub repository contains two JavaScript scripts for automating interactions with HackerRank, a popular coding challenge platform. The automation is achieved through two different methods: promise chaining and async/await.

Overview:

These scripts serve as practical examples of how to automate tasks on HackerRank using JavaScript. They demonstrate the ability to efficiently handle asynchronous operations while interacting with web elements, showcasing the power and flexibility of JavaScript in web automation.

Key Features:

Promise Chaining Method: This script demonstrates how to use promise chaining to automate tasks on HackerRank. It provides a structured and sequential approach to handling asynchronous operations.

Async/Await Method: The second script showcases the use of async/await, a more modern and concise way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It achieves the same automation tasks with a cleaner and more readable code structure.

Usage:

These scripts can be utilized for various purposes, such as automated testing, data scraping, or interaction with HackerRank challenges. Developers can choose the method that best fits their workflow and coding style.

Getting Started:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies (if any) mentioned in the script files.
Customize the scripts to suit your specific automation requirements.
Execute the scripts using a JavaScript runtime environment.
